This folder contains tutorials for how to bring your own model pipeline to the Azure Percept DK.

1. [Start Here](banana-unet-tutorial/banana-unet-tutorial.md) - This tutorial walks you through the workflow and tools you will typically use to
   bring a custom model. It uses a model that we have already written and have working.
1. [Use an OpenVINO zoo model](openvino-zoo-tutorial/openvino-model-zoo-tutorial.md) - This tutorial walks you through bringing a model from
   a model zoo - specifically the Intel OpenVINO Open Model Zoo.
1. [Train a new model from scratch using PyTorch and port the model to the device](pytorch-from-scratch-tutorial/pytorch-from-scratch-tutorial.md)
   - This tutorial is the most advanced one; it shows you how to go from nothing all the way to a fun model, but it relies on the stuff you learned
   in the previous two tutorials.
